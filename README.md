# number_guessing-game

This Number guessing game is made using C language.

First I have written the libraries which are necessary for this program.
i.e. <stdio.h><stdlib.h><time.h>

stdlib.h has the random function while will help us to create a random number.

time.h has time function which help us to change the random number every time we run the program.

After that using do while I have executed the rest of the program.

reason for using do while loop:-
  I want our program to run atleast 1 time.
  
  
  Thank You.
